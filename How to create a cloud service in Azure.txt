How to create a cloud service in Azure. 
	1) Launch the Windows azure powershell 
			PS C:\>New-AzureServiceProject myProject
	2)  Create a worker role (for simple PHP script) or a webrole (for a website) - A worker is best suited for a back-end script that will continue to run and needs to be amnually stopped. A webrole is best for an interactive website. 
		PS C:\myProject> Add-AzurePHPWebRole roleName  OR
		PS C:\myProject> Add-AzurePHPWorkerRole roleName

	3) Add the scripts inside the folder for the worker/web role. 

	4) You can test the scripts with the Azure emulator by running these commands: 
		PS C:\MyProject> Start-AzureEmulator and PS C:\MyProject> Stop-AzureEmulator

	5) Retrieve the online PUBLISH SETTINGS file by running this command: 
		Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile

	6) Import it into your folder 
		Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile and <file path>

	7) Publish the cloud service by running 
		PS C:\app\MyService> Publish-AzureServiceProject

	8) You can start and stop the script by rinning 	
		 Start-AzureService or Stop-AzureService
