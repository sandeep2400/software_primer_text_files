## MVC Architecture ##
### Controllers ###
* Controller is initialted whenever you request a page. 
* A controller canr ead data from POST, GET or SESSION values. 
* Addresses have a special importance in MVC frameworks -> They include parameters which specify WHICH controller is to be used. 
* You will have multiple controllers for each action and each controller will act on a different piece of the puzzle. 
*A typical web address when you use a controller is this: 
~~~
www.myweb.com/index.php?r=myController
r = router to a controller named myController
In Yii, all navigation through the index.php file and r does all the routing to the right controllers.
