# SSL Primer
1. SSL is Secure Socket Layers 
2. SSL is a process so that data passed between the user and the server is encrypted/decrypted so that no external 3rd party can hijack the connection. 
3. SSL acts as a digital passport which verifies the credentials of both yourself and the end web server. When both parties are verified, SLL grants a secured connection through HTTPS. This process is performed using CERTIFICATES. 

## SSL certificate includes: 
1. Owner's Name
2. Certificate's serial number used for identification
3. The certificate's expiration date
4. The Ceritifcate's public key used to encrypt information. 
5. The ceritificate's private key used to decrypt information (usually from a web server). 

6. Some certificates will have more information. None of this affects the end user; it only affects the conneciton between the server and remote computer.
